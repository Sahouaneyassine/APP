# The-Blind-Assist

This is a major project which is based on (Research + Applied) machine learning and Android Development. 

This project will help visual and hearing-impaired persons to detect Indian Currency. 

We created the Indian Currency Dataset(ICD) which currently has 6000 images.

(Initially we have used googles examples app, added our tflite model to it)
(We will modify the app according to our use case)
