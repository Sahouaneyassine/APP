# The-Blind-Assist

This project will help visual and hearing-impaired persons to detect Indian Currency. 

This is a major project which is based on (Research + Applied) machine learning and Android Development. 

We created the Indian Currency Dataset(ICD) which currently has 6000 images. ICD is a very rich dataset, which contains very diverse images. We have covered all the classes (none, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000). Also, we have covered all kind of notes images like older and newer, front and rear, in different lighting conditions etc.

We are using keras, tensorflow, fastai and pytorch libraries, to leverage the power of all.
And, we have achieved 99% accuracy on resnet50 and 90% accuracy on MobileNetV2 model.

(Initially we have used googles examples app, added our tflite model to it)

(We will modify the app according to our use case)
